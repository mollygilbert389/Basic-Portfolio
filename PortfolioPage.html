        Hi! I'm Molly! I'm from Boston & Woodstock, Vermont. It's hard to pick between the two because whenever I go "home" I fly into Boston, spend a few days there (time permiting) then head up to my family farm house in Woodstock, Vermont. I have one fat orange tabby cat rightfully named Pumpkin, and a fish not-so-rightfully named Sushi. I am currently working full-time as an Account Manager for a local IT comapny called GCS Tehcnologies. My background includes project management, some light design, and a whole lot of creativity. One of my favorite hobbies is going to flea marekts, and Round Top, Texas hosts one of the best flea markets in the nation. I love to find the biggest heaviest pieces of furniture and drag them home.
